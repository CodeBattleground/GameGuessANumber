Sample Game implimentation for "Guess a number between 1 and 100"

This is a sample implimentation of a game server for CodeBattleground.com.   It is a very simple game where
the player containers are to guess a number between 0 and 100.   When the game is started, the game server
will select a random number between 0 and 100 (inclusive).  On each player's turn, it may guess a number that
has not previously been guessed.   The server will respond with an indicator that the guess was "correct", "too high" or "too low".  The winner is the first player container to guess the number correctly.
